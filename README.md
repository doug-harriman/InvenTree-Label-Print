# Status

* InvenTree Python API requires newer version of InvenTree.
    * Upgrade looks like a separate project.
* Falling back to simpler method: cli for PN & description.
* Proto of image generator working, see `inventreelabel.py`
* The code in "phomemo_d30" is capable of printing to the Phomemo D35.
* Would like to get it to auto-connect Bluetooth printer.
* Need to get image converted per the example code in the d30 dir.
